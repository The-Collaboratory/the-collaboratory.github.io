While much work has been done on the function and structure of the habenula in animal models, in vivo imaging studies of the human....een the susceptibility and the effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) indicated that localized susceptibility enhancement in the habenula is more associated with increased paramagnetic (such as iron) rather than decreased diamagnetic (such as myelin) sources. Our results suggest that high-resolution QSM could make a potentially useful tool for substructure-resolved in vivo habenula imaging, and provide a groundwork for the future development of magnetic susceptibility as a quantitative biomarker for human habenula studies.",

        "abstract": "The Cambrian Period, primarily known for animal life diversifying, experienced global extinctions. Pulses of extinction in Cambrian Series 2 are exemplified by the disappearance of archaeocyath sponges and olenelline and redlichiid trilobites. However, the effect of such extinctions on outer shelf organisms, as typify Burgess Shale-type (BST) deposits, remains relatively unknown. The phylogeny of naraoiid arthropods, represented in BST deposits.....gh the Series 2 extinctions suggests that deeper offshore marine environments were resilient to extinction during periods of environmental stress. This study therefore provides novel empirical support for the asylum of BST communities, which may contribute to the taxonomic longevity and widespread geographic distribution of taxa in these biotas."
